## Domain Names

- If you want to replace your net address from yourchurchnamenp.netlify.app to yourchurchnamenp.org to make it more easy remember and easy spread, that is where the Domain Name works. Domain Name is actually a short net address converter.

> In our case, to replace yourchurchnamenp.netlify.com to yourchurchnamenp.org cost about 10 USD per year. There are many companies doing this business, you can search internet to find one.
